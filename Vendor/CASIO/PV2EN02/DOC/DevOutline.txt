1.Outline of Directory

	C:\
	<CASIO>
	|
	+------	<PV2xxx>
	|	|
	|	+------	<BIOS>		BIOS binary file for Simulator
	|	+------	<C>		C Program
	|	|	|
	|	|	+------	<BIN>		Binary for Simulator
	|	|	+------	<COM_H>		Common Header
	|	|	+------	<COM_LIB>	CASIO Library
	|	|	+------	<COM_LNK>	Common Link Information
	|	|	+------	<COM_OBJ>	Common Object
	|	|	+------	<SAMPLE>	Sample Addin Program
	|	|	+------	<USER_BIN>	Addin Program Binary Files
	|	|
	|	+------ <DOC>		Documents
	|	+------	<SIM>		Simulator
	|	+------	<TOOL>		Tools
	|

2.Making of Development Directory

	1)The directory is made in C\. (The directory name is a development name.)

	  Example:	<C>
	  		:
			+------	<SAMPLE>
			+------	<USER_BIN>
			+------	<GAME>		<- New Directory

	2)Please copy all content of <SAMPLE> directory onto a new directory.

	  Example:	<C\SAMPLE>			<C\GAME>
			|				|
			|MK.BAT			->	|MK.BAT
			|MAKEFILE		->	|MAKEFILE
			+------	<C>		->	+------	<C>		C souce files
			+------	<H>		->	+------	<H>		C header files
			+------	<Menuicon>	->	+------	<Menuicon>	Menu icon bmp
			+------	<OBJ>		->	+------	<OBJ>		Addin compile object
			+------	<ForDEBUG>	->	+------	<ForDEBUG>	compile object for simulator

3.Making of Program

	1)Please put the source file of C program on <C\NewDirectory\C>. 
	  Please put the header file of C program on <C\NewDirectory\H>.
	  Please do not change an individual size, and change the BMP file by the binary of black and white.

	  Exsample:	<C\GAME>
			|
			|MK.BAT
			|MAKEFILE
			+------	<C>
			|	|GAME.C
			|	+
			|
			+------	<H>
			|	|GAME.H
			|	+
			|
			+------	<Menuicon>
			|	|icon.bmp
			|	|Licon.bmp
			|	+
			|
			+------	<ForDEBUG>
			+------	<OBJ>

	2)"MAKEFILE" changes by the developed program.

	  Exsample:
		"MAKEFILE"
		+---------------------------------------------------------------+
		|#Makefile for PocketViewer Sample Program			|
		|								|
		|include ..\COM_LNK\MakeSDK.1					|<-Do not change.
		|								|
		|### -------- Define Make Application -------- ###		|
		|								|
		|#== TargetName ==						|
		|TARGET  = GAME							|<-Change in this time
		|								|
		|#== Program Name ==						|
		|PROGNAME = "Game"						|<-Change in this time
		|								|
		|#== ProgramVersion(Ver0.50) ==					|
		|VERSION = 0050							|<-Change in this time
		|								|
		|#== MenuIcon (Xsize=45dot,Ysize=28dot) ==			|
		|MICON = menuicon\icon.bmp					|
		|								|
		|#== ListMenuIcon (Xsize=27dot,Ysize=20dot) ==			|
		|LICON = menuicon\Licon.bmp					|
		|								|
		|#== CompileObjectFile ==					|
		|APLOBJS = $(ODIR)\game.obj					|<-Change in this time
		|								|
		|#== IncludeHeaderFile ==					|
		|HEADFILE = $(HDIR)\game.h					|<-Change in this time
		|								|
		|### ----------------------------------------- ###		|
		|								|
		|include ..\COM_LNK\MakeSDK.2					|<-Do not change.
		+---------------------------------------------------------------+
		Change neither $(ODIR) nor $(HDIR).  


	3)Please do the compilation and the link by using "MK.BAT".

	4)The made program is output to <C\USER_BIN>. 

	  Example:	<C\USER_BIN>
	  		|GAME.BIN		<-Made Addin Program
			|

	(Attention)
	When generating a file in the "Addin" program, write a generated file name with the document and so on.


4.Debugging of Program

	1)Please change the "SIM\PV750.CPJ" like the following example.

	  Example:
	
		"SIM\PV750.CPJ"
		[GENERAL]
		ProjectName=PocketViewer
		CurrentDir=C:\CASIO\PV2EM02\
		SourceDir=C:\CASIO\PV2EM02\C\GAME\		<- It Changed from "SAMPLE" to "GAME"

			:

		[CSGROUP5]

			:

		CHIPNAME3=UserProgram1
		CHIPFILE3=C\Bin\GAME.BIN		<- It Changed from "SAMPLE.BIN" to "GAME.BIN".
		CHIPPROGAREA3=0
		CHIPOFFSET3=140000
		CHIPKIND3=1
		CHIPCODE3=
		CHIPBUS3=8

			:

	2)Please execute "SIM\SIM3022.EXE".

	3)Operation of "SIM3022" (1)
	   Please open "PV750.CPJ" by [File] and [Open Project].
	   Next operation is [Source] and [Load Symbol File].(Example:Symbol file is "C\GAME\ForDEBUG.MAP".)
	   Program run is [F9] key or [Run] and [Run].(PV emulation start.)
	   Please refer to "DOC\Simdoc22_E.pdf" for details.

	4)Operation of PV on "SIM3022" (1)
	   At first, reset PV.
	   Please interrupt emulation with the [ESC] key when PV becomes a clock display.  

	5)Operation of "SIM3022" (2)
	   Please click [File] and [Close Project],and select "No" at "Save Current Project?".
	   Please operate above-mentioned 3) again.  

	6)Operation of PV on "SIM3022" (2)
	   Please do not reset PV this time,and click MENU when PV becomes a clock display.
	   The Addin program can be executed from the Menu screen.  


5.Download Addin Program

	1)Please connect with Cradle cable between PC and PV,and execute "TOOL\PVM.EXE".

	2)Operation of PV
	   Please click the "Menu" icon, "MenuBar" and "Download" on PV.
	   After that,PV enters in waiting mode for connecting to PC.

	3)Operation of "PV Applications Manager"(PVM)
	   Please click [Execute] and [Inport from PV].(PV enters the state of a remote control.)
	   Next operation opens "C\USER_BIN\GAME.BIN" by [File] and [Add file].
	   Please click [Execute] and [Inport from PV] if "C\USER_BIN\GAME.BIN" is loaded into "PV Applications Manager".  
	   ("GAME.BIN" is an example of this time.)
	   Please refer to "DOC\PVM.TXT" for details.
